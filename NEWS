# varhandle 2.0.1

###Changes to existing functions

* `pin.na()`
    - Change the type of output to data.frame to make it easier to access
      via `$`.
    - Now returns NULL in case it does not find any NA. This change has
	   been done to make it easier to combine it with `is.NULL()`
* `check.numeric()`
    - The rm.na argument has changed to na.rm in order to make it similar
      to the convention that other packages and functions are using.
    - The function now detects "-.2", "3.", "" and NA as numbers as well.
    - The default value of argument `na.rm` has changed to `FALSE` in order to
      take NAs into account.
    - An option added to ignore leading and tailing whitespace characters
      from items in vector before assessing if they can be converted to
      numeric.
* `rm.all.but()`
    - Added the ability to call garbage collection if the size of the
      removed variables exceed the new parameter `gc_limit`.
    - Added a new parameter `keep_functions` to automatically exclude all
      functions from being removed.
* `var.info()`
    - Now can handle matrix-like objects with multiple classes.


### New functions

* `inspect.na()`: This function is calls `pin.na()` and produce a human readable
                  data.frame of NA status of columns in addition to a barplot
                  and/or histogram.
